Slackcurrent-0.1.6 - 2008-03-04
-------------------------------

- The version tokens were expanded to 4 tokens now. There were some problem (again!)
  with packages with crazy names (and they were official ones!) so I decided to expand
  the version tokens to 4 to try to deal with more exceptions. Thanks to Trevor Carey-Smith
  for warning me about that!

- A lot more of testing on slackcurrent_test.py.

- When asked to create the upgrade list, Slackcurrent now tells you about some packages
  (local and remote) that will not be handled because of their name formats. Maybe the
  names are ok and you just found another bug, but there are some packages that really
  don't follow the package name conventions. You'll need to download and upgrade those
  packages manually.

- The invalid local packages can be checked using -li or --list-invalid-local. If you
  are using Slackcurrent as part of another app, you can get the list using the
  getlocalinvalidlist() method.  

- The invalid remote packages can be checked using -ri or --list-invalid-remote. If you
  are using Slackcurrent as part of another app, you can get the list using the
  getremoteinvalidlist() method.  

Slackcurrent-0.1.5 - 2007-10-25
-------------------------------
- Fixed a bug about how to check some packages with version numbers like 1.2.99.905
  were calculated. The number got an overflow on the 3 digits limit and there we go
  to avoid updates to the package. :-(

- Added an unit test file on /etc/slackcurrent.  

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.1.4 - 2006-04-11

- Fixed a bug about a bug. Some packages have rc versions like rc3_2. I don't know why 
  people use an underline char on a rc version and between two numbers, but I remove it
  now and it counts like a 32 on the previous examples. I know that this can make some
  mess also, we need to pay attention on this kind of weird names.

- Now if you use some chars on the build token, it's converted to a number. For example,
  package-1.2.3-i386-a.tgz will be older than package-1.2.3-i386-b.tgz.
  
- Added the -df (--download-from) option. With this option you can check for the required
  local packages on some remote directory on your network. Please check the manual about
  how to use it.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.1.3 - 2006-03-23

- Finally added an AUTHORS and CHANGELOG (this file!) to the package.

- Fixed a bug on the changelog option. There was some &nbsp; HTML entity on the output.

- Fixed a bug with underline (_) chars on package names. The underline char is replaced 
  by a zero to make a good version *number* (I mean, something that can be handle as a
  number!). Some packages that have an underline char and was upgraded when I fixed it
  today are:
  
	hotplug-2004_09_23-noarch-5
	imagemagick-6.2.6_1-i486-1
	iproute2-2.6.15_060110-i486-1
	mod_ssl-2.8.25_1.3.34

  Everyday a new surprise on how people build their packages version numbers. :-p

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.1.2 - 2005-12-16

- Added the -cl/--changelog option. Now you can check the latest i386 current changelog 
  for new stuff and messages from Patrick. :-)
	  
-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.1.1 - 2005-08-15

- Added the option -um (or --update-mirrors) to update the mirrors list file.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.1.0 - 2005-08-08

- The way the version number are calculated was fully rewritten. Now it's better and 
  faster. There is some tips on the man page about how to use the Slackcurrent objects 
  and methods inside other Python apps.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.9 - 2005-06-27

- I found a bug on some packages with the char "e" on it's names, on the last 
  positions. Seems that some package with a version like 0.123e4 was interpreted as 
  a infinite number on slackcurrent. After this version I'll make a big study about 
  all the package naming conventions (and possibilities) and should release 0.1.0 
  with a new way to check this.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.8 - 2005-05-11

- Fixed a bug with packages with versions like 0.1.2 and with names with "-". 
  Thanks to Jeremy Wagner to warning me about that. :-)
  
-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.7 - 2005-03-16

- Fixed a small bug about rc's packages. Thanks to Maurizio from deprecated.it 
  for warning me about this. :-)

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.6 - 2005-02-02

- There was a bug on the previous version, when checking for the highest version 
  package. Thanks to Wim Speekenbrink for warning me about that, and excuse my 
  fault. :-(

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.5 - 2005-02-01

- Now, if there is a repeated package, with two or more versions, the package 
  with the higher version is choosen. To allow packages on the testing series 
  (not checked when using the default upgrade option now) , was added a new option: 
  
  -ut or --upgradetesting 
  
  If you use slackcurrent.py on the same way as other versions, it will ignore all 
  the packages on the testing serie. If you want to check it, please use the option 
  above.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.4 - 2004-07-03

- Fixed a bug where packages with build greater than 9 was not being retrieved.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.3 - 2004-06-12

- Added a new option to check for new packages since the last upgrade. 
  It's the -ln (or --list-new) option. 
- Added a new option to check all the downloaded tgz files on the current dir with 
  their asc signature. You can use -cs (or --check-signature) to run Slackcurrent 
  and gpg to make this.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.2 - 2004-05-30

- Now you can use local dirs and/or drives to use as the source of the newest packages
- Fixed a stupid bug that was not retrieving the build version of the local packages
- Fixed the way Slackcurrent sees versions with _ chars and/or alpha chars.

-------------------------------
Slackcurrent-0.0.1 - 2004-05-26

Initial release.
